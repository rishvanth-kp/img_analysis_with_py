    "# What is an image?\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is a static snapshot of a scene.  Let us start with an analog image\n",
    "and work through understating a digital image. An example of an analog image is\n",
    "a photograph taken with an old fashioned camera on a physical photosensitive\n",
    "film.  If we were to take a large magnifying glass and zoom in on a really\n",
    "small area, the colors on the image will change in a very 'smooth' manner\n",
    "without any discontinuities. Such an image is an analog image, which is in\n",
    "essence a 'perfect' representation of the captured object where every possible\n",
    "detail of an image is captured.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our computers are extremely good at storing an manipulating massive amounts of\n",
    "numerical values.  That is they store digital discreet values, and hence\n",
    "impossible for them to store numerical values for infinitesimally small\n",
    "intervals when moving along an image. Our computers store a 'digitized' version\n",
    "of an image. An image is digitized by diving an analog image into grids.  Each\n",
    "grid represents a pixel, and each pixel stores the average value of the light\n",
    "falling in that square, that is each pixel stores one value. The smaller the\n",
    "grid the smaller the area of the image capture by the grid, and hence more\n",
    "grids are required to cover the entire image. Making the grids smaller\n",
    "increased the resolution of the image, however it comes at the cost of storing\n",
    "more values per image (and so increasing the image size). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a digital image, at each pixel the intensity \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, all digital cameras and microscopes do not capture an analog image\n",
    "and convert them to a digital image, but rater they capture a digital image\n",
    "directed. The most common methods used for capturing digital images in a\n",
    "microscope are CMOS-CCD such as used in most wide-field microscopes and PMT\n",
    "such as used in most confocal microscopes. The details of how these senors work\n",
    "are irrelevant here, and we obtain a final digital image from them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have divided an image into a fixed number of grids and have the\n",
    "average intensity at each grid, how are these values actually stored in a\n",
    "computer and how can we manipulate them?  We will use make extensive use of two\n",
    "python packages,`numpy` and `scikit-image`, for our image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An image is a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary image\n",
    "As we have seem an image is a grid of pixels. A grid is most easily represented\n",
    "as matrix. The dimensions of the matrix corresponding to the size of an image.\n",
    "Each element of the matrix correspond to a pixel. A two dimensional matrix of\n",
    "size 6 * 8 would represent an image that is 6 pixels in height and 8 pixels in\n",
    "width, and the intensity is stored at each pixel.  The images in `ski-image`\n",
    "are represented as `numpy` arrays:"
