        "An image is a static snapshot of a scene.  Let us start with an analog image\n",

        "a photograph taken with an old fashioned camera on a physical photosensitive\n",
        "film.  If we were to take a large magnifying glass and zoom in on a really\n",
        "small area, the colors on the image will change in a very 'smooth' manner\n",
        "without any discontinuities. Such an image is an analog image, which is in\n",
        "essence a 'perfect' representation of the captured scene where every possible\n",
        "detail is captured.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Our computers are extremely good at storing an manipulating massive amounts of\n",

        "intervals when moving along an image. Our computers store a 'digitized' version\n",
        "of an image. An image is digitized by diving an analog image into grids.  Each\n",
        "grid represents a pixel, and each pixel stores the average value of the light\n",
        "falling in that square, that is each pixel stores one value. The smaller the\n",
        "grid the smaller the area of the image capture by the grid, and hence more\n",
        "grids are required to cover the entire image. Making the grids smaller\n",
        "increased the resolution of the image, however it comes at the cost of storing\n",
        "more values per image (and so increasing the image size). \n",
        "\n",
        "Obviously, all digital cameras and microscopes do not capture an analog image\n",
